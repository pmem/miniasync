# NAME #

**miniasync_vdm** - Virtual data mover API for miniasync library


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libminiasync.h>

struct vdm_descriptor *vdm_descriptor_synchronous(void);
struct vdm_descriptor *vdm_descriptor_pthreads(void);

struct vdm *vdm_new(struct vdm_descriptor *descriptor);
void vdm_delete(struct vdm *vdm);
```

For general description of miniasync see **miniasync**(7).


# DESCRIPTION #

XXX: add description here.

`struct vdm_descriptor *vdm_descriptor_synchronous(void);`

:	XXX add description here.

`struct vdm_descriptor *vdm_descriptor_pthreads(void);`

:   In order to use parallel memcpy on os threads, create appropriate
descriptor:
```c
struct vdm_descriptor *vdm_async_descriptor = vdm_descriptor_pthreads();
```
Then, create a new virtual data mover instance using that descriptor:
```c
struct vdm *vdm = vdm_new(vdm_async_descriptor);
```
From now on, every future created with `vdm_memcpy` and previously
created instance of data mover `struct vdm_memcpy_future fut = vdm_memcpy(vdm, dst, src, size, flags);`
will be performed asynchronously.
Every time a future is polled it tries to add it's memcpy into queue until it succedes. The queue is dequeued, regarding the policy set in
`struct vdm_pthread_queue`, and processed by background worker threads.

`struct vdm *vdm_new(struct vdm_descriptor *descriptor);`

:	XXX add description here.

`void vdm_delete(struct vdm *vdm);`

:	XXX add description here.


## ERRORS ##
