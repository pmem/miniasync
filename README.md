For more information, see [pmem.io](https://pmem.io).

## Building

Requirements:
- C compiler
- cmake >= 3.3
- pkg_config

First, you have to create a `build` directory.
From there you have to prepare the compilation using CMake.
The final build step is just a `make` command.

```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```
